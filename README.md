SASS Compass CSS3 Code Hinting for Dreamweaver
==============================================

This Adobe Dreamweaver extension provides SASS code coloring and code hinting for the CSS3 functions available in SASS Compass.

Right now this is pretty quick and dirty and currently only supports the CSS3 portion of the Compass api.

I built this to make my live easier for developing with Compass in Dreamweaver. Anyone is welcome to use this and encouraged improve upon it.

Usage
-----

Install the extension by opening the .zxp *or* .mxi in Adobe Extension manager.

When editing a SASS/CSS file, you will notice code completion/hinting when you start type an @include mixin. You will subsequently see a list of available Compass mixins as you continue typing.
